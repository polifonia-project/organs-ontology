The Organs ontology module of the [Polifonia ontology network](https://github.com/polifonia-project/ontology-network) represents concepts and relationships that describe pipe organs. The ontology describes the organ in a two-fold way:
- as a musical instrument that consists of parts 
- as a focal point of a project that describes the historical changes of the organ throughout the years.
